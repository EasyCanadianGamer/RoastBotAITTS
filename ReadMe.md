# This is Roast Bot with TTS

This bot roasts you on what ever application you are on so if I am on vscode its gonna roast my ass or any application I use. Currently it works for MacOs and Windows. Idk if I am gonna make it for Linux as thats not on my todo list or anything. It can also read minecraft logs and roasts you on what ever action u doing.
